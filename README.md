# Cow Counting
This project is to show number of corner cows and also number of adjacent cows in a square grid field. Seperate unit test project also added.
The programme is written as a console application. you can input the 'field size' and 'number of cows' should be in the field. But number of cows should always be smaller than the square the field size.

Ex : field size - 4 --> Number of Cows <= 16

Programme itself will generate the given number of cows in random positions within the grid and the output will be based on the positions generated by the programme.
