# Cow Counting
This project is to show number of corner cows(Task #01) and also number of adjacent cows(Task #02) in a square grid field. The programme is written as a .net core console application. you can input the 'field size' and 'number of cows' should be in the field. But number of cows should always be smaller than the square the field size.

Ex : field size - 4 --> Number of Cows <= 16

Programme itself will generate the given number of cows in random positions within the specified grid and the output will be based on the positions generated by the programme. You can build and run the programme from any .net compatible IDE and I was using VS 2019.

Also Seperate unit test project is added and it is covering both positive and negative scenarios. you can run the unit tests from VS 2019.
